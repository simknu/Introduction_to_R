# Title: Hypothesis testing

# Description: Short introduction to hypothesis testing and linear models in R.
#  This script shows some commands that can be used for hypothesis testing 
#  or linear models, but it does not give the statistical background to these 
#  functions. Please refer to statistical help for this.
#  1) General workflow
#  2) Two sample tests
#  3) Linear models

# 1) General workflow --------------------
#    1. Formulate hypothesis
#    2. Perform the experiment / Collect data
#    3. Explore data
#    4. Test hypothesis with appropriate test (check test assumptions!)






# 2) Two sample tests --------------------

# Test whether two group means are the same


# Two sample t-test ------

# Test assumptions: 
# i) independent groups (paired = FALSE): data is normally distributed
#    (+ equal variances)
# ii) dependent groups (paired = TRUE): data is normally distributed







# Wilcoxon test ------

# Test assumptions: 
# i) independent groups (paired = FALSE): groups have the same distribution
# ii) dependent groups (paired = TRUE): groups have the same distribution









# 3) Linear models --------------------
